### 2. Create stacks and cards
Stacks are simply columns with list of cards. It can represent a category of tasks or an y step in your projects for example.

What about the cards? Cards are tasks, objects or ideas that fit into a stack. You can put a lot of cards in a stack! An infinity? Who knows! Who knows!   

And all the magic of this software consists on moving your cards from a stack to an other.

### 5. Manage your board
You can manage the settings of your Deck once you are inside it, by clicking on the small wheel at the top right.
Once in this menu, you have access to several things:

- Sharing
- Tags
- Deleted objects
- Timeline

The **sharing tab** allows you to add users or even groups to your boards.  
**Tags** allows you to modify the tags available for the cards.  
**Deleted objects** allows you to return previously deleted stacks or cards.  
The **Timeline** allows you to see everything that happened in your boards. Everything!

## Search

Deck provides a global search either through the unified search in the Nextcloud header or with the inline search next to the board controls.
This search allows advanced filtering of cards across all board of the logged in user.

For example the search `project tag:ToDo assigned:alice assigned:bob` will return all cards where the card title or description contains project **and** the tag ToDo is set **and** the user alice is assigned **and** the user bob is assigned.

### Supported search filters

| Filter      | Operators         | Query                                                        |
| ----------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| title       | `:`               | text token used for a case-insentitive search on the cards title |
| description | `:`               | text token used for a case-insentitive search on the cards description |
| list        | `:`               | text token used for a case-insentitive search on the cards list name |
| tag         | `:`               | text token used for a case-insentitive search on the assigned tags |
| date        | `:`               | 'overdue', 'today', 'week', 'month', 'none'                  |
|             | `>` `<` `>=` `<=` | Compare the card due date to the passed date (see [supported date formats](https://www.php.net/manual/de/datetime.formats.php)) Card due dates are always considered UTC for comparison |
| assigned    | `:`               | id or displayname of a user or group for a search on the assigned users or groups |

Other text tokens will be used to perform a case-insensitive search on the card title and description

In addition wuotes can be used to pass a query with spaces, e.g. `"Exact match with spaces"` or `title:"My card"`.
